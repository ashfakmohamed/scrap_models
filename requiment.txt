WebDriver: Selenium requires a WebDriver to interface with the chosen browser. For instance, if you are using Chrome, you need the ChromeDriver.

Download ChromeDriver
Make sure the ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version.
After downloading, place the executable in a directory that is included in your system's PATH.

# Change this path to your chromedriver location
webdriver_service = Service("C:/Program Files/chromedriver.exe")

# File Package for selenium
